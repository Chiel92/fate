SHORT TERM
should insert mode be managed inside fatelib? More generally, should fatelib be able to ask for user input?
add functools.wraps everywhere
make selectors either work on session or work isolated
support autoindent
add select around/inside, switch case,
make distinction between undo selector and undo operator
implement repeat last selector or operator

LONG TERM
implement fix interval functionality
add unit tests
switch to alternative regex engine
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
persistent session (using a context manager)
