SHORT TERM
should all operators really subclass from operation? Do we want to store the action, or just the operations involved? For a compound action (containing non-undoable actions): do we want to store the whole thing, or just a list/tuple of operations.
add functools.wraps everywhere
support autoindent
add select around/inside, switch case,
implement repeat last selector or operator
add unit tests
put code in seperate directory

LONG TERM
persistent session (using a context manager?)
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
some sort of semantic snippet recognition, e.g. two identifiers that always need to be the same. If one changes, the other changes with it.
implement fix interval/selection functionality?
switch to alternative regex engine?
focus on non-atomic operations
