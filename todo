fix bug that prevents selecting previous line when last \n is selected
make actions undoable instead of just single operations (this is hard)
    making distinction between actors and actions is likely to fix this
    Somehow we need to prevent bypassing the apply function in session
better clipboard (maybe stack based?)
add match parenthesis
add block selectors
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
add support for plugins in home directory
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
persistent session (using a context manager)
