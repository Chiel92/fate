fix bug that prevents selecting previous line when last \n is selected
add unit tests

switch to alternative regex engine
add match parenthesis
add block selectors
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
persistent session (using a context manager)
