refactor operator and selector architecture
allow backspacing as insert operations (or a better equivalent)
idea: join n split functions
    Join could be easily implemented.
    Split should maybe be implemented as an even more advanced way
    of doing selections. One should be able to select all possible
    occurences. Splitting is then equal to reducing with all possible
    occurences. This suggests some sort of idea of quantors:
    previous, next, forall
    either inside, outside (default) or anywhere.
    In the anywhere case, next_word would select the first word of the text.
    In the inside case, next_word would select the first word
        inside the selection, for each interval.
    In the outside case, next_word would select the first word
        after the selection, for each interval, just as default.
Selecting within another selection could also be useful.
better undo system
