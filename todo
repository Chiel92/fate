SHORT TERM
add functools.wraps everywhere
put code in seperate directory
add tests
implement repeat last selector or operator
add select around/inside, switch case,

LONG TERM
persistent session (using a context manager?)
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
some sort of semantic snippet recognition, e.g. two identifiers that always need to be the same. If one changes, the other changes with it.
implement fix interval/selection functionality?
switch to alternative regex engine?
focus on non-atomic operations
idea: jumplist of lines of changes

RESEARCH
optimal configurable datastructure for text editing
    optimize it for linenumber queries as well, not only for char numbers
optimal configurable datastructure for labeling/syntax highlighting
