some convenient higher level operators, such as 'open line'
fix reduce and extend to work with the new selector behaviour
    I think this is fairly easy: in all modes the pattern selector has to iterate until the current selection changes
It is probably necessary to reconsider the selector-operator design.
    Options:
        - Session gets new field operation, and selectors always get the session passed which they can modify. However, this doesn't restrict what operators and selectors do in any way: they both just modify the session arbitrarily. Unless being a selector means being decorated by @selector. Hm, that sounds nice.
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
maybe change behaviour of selectors to start selecting within
better clipboard (maybe stack based?)
    Also be able to use system clipboards
add backwards find (F)
add support for plugins in home directory
persistent session (using a context manager)
