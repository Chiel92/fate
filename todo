refactor operator and selector architecture
allow backspacing as insert operations
implement 'extend till interval' in addition to 'extend (with selection)'
    question: maybe this should be decided by the selector itself
idea: join n split system
better (persistent) undo system
some general labelings such as bracket pairs
add support for plugins in home directory
