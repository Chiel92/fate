SHORT TERM
add functools.wraps everywhere
support autoindent
add select around/inside, switch case,
implement repeat last selector or operator
add unit tests

LONG TERM
implement fixed interval functionality?
switch to alternative regex engine?
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
focus on non-atomic operations
some sort of semantic snippet recognition, e.g. two identifiers that always need to be the same. If one changes, the other changes with it.
persistent session (using a context manager?)
