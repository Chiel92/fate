make macros undoable instead of just single operations
better clipboard (maybe stack based?)
add match parenthesis
add block selectors
improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes in comments
add support for plugins in home directory
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
persistent session (using a context manager)
