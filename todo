consistent use of default selection etc
some convenient higher level operators, such as 'open line'
contextual completion
    It is probably necessary to reconsider the operator design.
    In order to be able to control the insertion of text,
    the inserted text shouldn't be restricted to the user interface.
    Note that this is also needed for completion.
    Options:
        - Session gets new fields insertions, deletions, operation
        - Somehow make operators more incremental. This bothers
          however insert_before to have proper deletions and to have
          the insertions in the right order
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. This would make life
    more easy for the user interface as well, but would probably
    require a fast datastructure for large files.
maybe change behaviour of selectors to start selecting within
better clipboard (maybe stack based?)
    Also be able to use system clipboards
add support for plugins in home directory
persistent session (using a context manager)
