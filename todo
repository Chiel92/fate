refactor operator and selector architecture
allow backspacing as insert operations
implement 'extend till interval' in addition to 'extend (with selection)'
    question: maybe this should be decided by the selector itself
idea: join n split system
better (persistent) undo system
better (persistent) clipboard (maybe stack based?)
    Also be able to use system clipboards
some general labelings such as bracket pairs
add support for plugins in home directory
