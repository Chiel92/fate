some convenient higher level operators, such as 'open line'
turn copy paste into actions
make macros undoable instead of just single operations
contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be
    constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
better clipboard (maybe stack based?)
add backwards find (F)
add support for plugins in home directory
persistent session (using a context manager)
