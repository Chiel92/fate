SHORT TERM
fix autoindent and select indent
how to define a keymap for each interactive action?
Select around/inside (not done yet)
Repeat last selector or operator
    idea: repeat last action most-top-level which resulted in a text change
    we may need a single function which always executes actions, to be able to store the right ones
Incorporate testing with multiple sessions
Check if we can specify multiple testruns more easily in the unittest framework
make travis fail if tests fail
unittests for pattern select machinery
Make labeling generation asynchronous

LONG TERM
Persistent session (using a context manager?)
Improve syntax highlighting, for instance by disregarding quotes inside comments and strings
    select around should maybe also disregard brackets etc in comments and strings
Contextual completion
    For completion it is also needed that the full text can be constructed including the pending operation. (No it isn't!! Only filtering is done based on the input, the context is not changed)
Some sort of semantic snippet recognition, e.g. two identifiers that always need to be the same. If one changes, the other changes with it.
Switch to alternative regex engine?
Focus on non-atomic operations
Idea: jumplist of lines of changes

RESEARCH
Optimal configurable datastructure for text editing
    optimize it for linenumber queries as well, not only for char numbers
Optimal configurable datastructure for labeling/syntax highlighting
Store additional metadata such as the number of line breaks in a certain range
